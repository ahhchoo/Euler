/**
 * Sum Square Difference
 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
 * 
 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
 * 
 * Hence the difference between 
 * the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers 
 * and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 * 
 * Find the difference 
 * between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers 
 * and the square of the sum.
